                                                        JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
						        ===========0000=================


File systems Limitations :
=====================
a) We cannot store huge amount of data/information.
b)Query Language does not support (where ,like ,groupby ,fk,pk,unique constraints....etc)
c)There is no security for data.
d)There is not support for constraints to mainain unique data..etc.


To Overcome the above limitations/problems of file system, we should have to go database;


Databases:
==========
1)We can store Huge amount data (in the form of tables...etc).
2)Query Language supports( i.e supports like uniqueConstraints ,where ,like ,groupby ,fk,pk..etc)
3)Databases provide security and also support ACID properties.


In java there are 3 Editions are avialable :

1) Java Standard Edition (JSE /J2SE) or Core Java
2)Java Enterprise Edition (JEE /J2EE) or Adv.java
3)Java Micro Edition         (JME/J2ME) or Andriod 

Note : JDBC is a part of JSE .


 Steps to develop JDBC Application ::
 ==============================
 1)Load and Register Driver
 2)Establish Connection b/w Java Application and Database  (Road)
 3)Create Statement Object    (Vehicle)
 4)Send and Execute SQL Query (Input to Vehicle as SQL query..etc)
 5)Process Results from ResultSet
 6)Close the connection


 Sample Program :
 ================
 1)Load and Register Driver                                        : DriverManager
     Class.forName("**************Mysql/Oracle/DB2/Potsgress.....******")

2)Establish Connection b/w Java Application and Database  (Road)

Connection con =DriverManager.getConnection("path","username","password");

3)Create Statement Object    (Vehicle)

Statement st = con.createStatement();  (Vehicle)

 4)Send and Execute SQL Query (Input to Vehicle as SQL query..etc)

     ResultSet rs    = st.executeQuery("select * from TableName.......");

    While(rs.next()){
      ...........//processing
      }

5)Close the connection
        con.close();


Q)Write a java program to connect Database . 

  public class DBConnect{


    public static void main(String[] args){
      //#01 .Load and Register Driver with DriverManager
        Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");

	//#02.Establish Connection b/w Java Application and Database  (Road)
	Connection  con =DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/demo","root","root");

          3)Create Statement Object    (Vehicle)

              Statement st = con.createStatement();  //(Vehicle)

          4)Send and Execute SQL Query (Input to Vehicle as SQL query..etc)

             ResultSet rs    = st.executeQuery("select * from employee");

          5)Process Results from ResultSet
	  
	  while(rs.next()){
            System.out.println(rs.getInt(0));
	    }

       6)Close the connection
             con.close();
   }
}

Important Classes 



JDBC API :

->JDBC API provides serval classes and Interfaces;
->Developer/Programmer  can use these classes and interface to communicate with the
  database
 ->Database software vendor can uses the JDBC API while developing driver software 

 ->JDBC API provides two packages ::


 1)java.sql.* pkg
 2)javax.sql.*


 1)java.sql.* pkg      : basic Classes and Interfaces Which can be used for DB communication
 
    interfaces :
    a)Driver
    b)Connection
    c)Statement
    d)PreparedStatement
    e)CallableStatement
    f)ResultSet
    h)ResultSetMetaData
    i)DatabaseMetaData

    Classes :
    a)DriverManager
    b)Date
    c)Time
    d)Timestamp
    e)Types
       
   

 2)javax.sql.*  : advanced Classes and Interfaces Which can be used for DB communication
  
  interfaces :
  a)DataSource
  b)RowSet (Types)
  c)CommonDataSource
  d)ConnectionPoolDataSource




[Java App] ------->[DriverManager] -------->[Driver (Mysql) (s/w)]-----[Mysql DB]

Here Mysql DB vendors responsible to develop driver s/w 

                 <dependency>
			<groupId>mysql</groupId>
			<artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
			<version>8.0.30</version>

Types of Drivers ::

    Type 1: JDBC-ODBC bridge.
    Type 2: partial Java driver.
    Type 3: pure Java driver for database middleware.
    Type 4: pure Java driver for direct-to-database.
    Type 5: highly-functional drivers with superior performance.

Steps to develop JDBC Application ::
 ==============================
 1)Load and Register Driver
 2)Establish Connection b/w Java Application and Database  (Road)
 3)Create Statement Object    (Vehicle)
 4)Send and Execute SQL Query (Input to Vehicle as SQL query..etc)
 5)Process Results from ResultSet
 6)Close the connection



1)Load and Register Driver :
 Registration of Driver is Optional from Type 4 Driver.
 2)Establish Connection b/w Java Application and Database  (Road)
  Connection  con =DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/demo","root","root");
3)Create Statement Object    (Vehicle)

->Once we established connection b/w java app and DB s/w.

input  : SQL (Structure Query Language)

                                                                                                                    // We are calling on Con object
    Statement createStatement() throws SQLException;
    PreparedStatement prepareStatement(String sql) throws SQLException;
    CallableStatement prepareCall(String sql) throws SQLException;


      Statement st = con.createStatement();  //(Vehicle)

4)Send and Execute SQL Query (Input to Vehicle as SQL query..etc)

According to Database specification ,all SQL Commands are divided into following types

 a)DDL (Data Defination Language ) Commands
  Eg :   drop ,rename,create ,alter ,truncate                                 //DR.CAT
b)DML (Data Manipulation Language ) Commands
 Eg : update ,delete,insert

 c)DQL (Data Retrieval Language) Commands
 Eg :Select

d)DCL (Data Control Language ) Commands
Eg : Alter Password, Grant Access (Permission)

e)TCL (Transaction Control Language ) Commands
Eg :Commit ,Rollback ,Savepoint ..etc


According to Java Developers point of View ,all SQL commands divided into two types:

a)Select Operation (DQL)
b)Non-Select Operation (DML,DDL,..ect)



a)Select Operation  :
Whenever we are performing Select operation then we  get bunch of records
 eg : Select * from employee

 b)Non-Select Operation 
Whenever we are performing Non-Select operation  then we will get numeric 
value that will represent the number of rows effected

eg : update employee esal=easl+200 where ename like '%raghu'

Once we create statement object , we will get the following methods on that object

 i)boolean execute(String sql) throws SQLException;       (Select & Non-Select SQL queries)
 ii)ResultSet executeQuery(String sql) throws SQLException; (Select SQL Queries)
 iii) int executeUpdate(String sql) throws SQLException;   (Non-Select SQL Queries)


Note : 
                Based on our requirement We have to use corresponding  approriate method 
		     i)stmt.executeQuery()           //Select
		     ii)stmt.executeUpdate()       //Non-select
		    iii)stmt.execute()                    // true  ? Select ?Non-select
                   iv)stmt.getResultSet()           // To get ResultSet
		   v)stmt.getUpdateCount();     //To get updater ow Count


5)Process Results from ResultSet
	  
	  
       a)boolean next() throws SQLException;


Conclusion :
1)ResultSet follow 'iterator' design pattern
2)ResultSet object is always associated with Statement object
3)Per Statement Only one ResultSet is possible at a time ,if we are trying  to open 
  another ResultSet  then automatically previouslly or first opened resultset will be closed.

ex :

ResultSet rsOne    = st.executeQuery("select * from employee");

ResultSet rsTwo    = st.executeQuery("select * from employee where id=20");


 6)Close the connection::

 After completing DB operation ,it is highly recommended to close the resource 

  a)rs.close();
   it closes the ResultSet and won't allow any further proccess of that Result

   b)stmt.close();
    it closes the Statement and won't allow any sending furrther queries to DB.

    c)con.close();
    it closes the connection and won't allow any further communication with DB.



Conclusions ::
*************
a)Per Statement only one ResultSet  is possible at a time.
b)Per Connection  multiple Statements Objects are possible
c)Whenever we are closing statement object then automatically corresponding  ResultSet objs
 will be closed
 d)Similarly Whenever we are closing connection obj automatically corresponding  Statement objs
 will be closed
 e)...Final we must  need to close at least con object

#Normal : Manually we want close the resources in finally block (By remembering..?)
 try{

   }catch(Exception e){

   }finally{

   }

## TryWithResources ::

   try(){

   }catch(Exception e){

   }

   Resources (ResultSet,Statement,Connection) must be Autocloseable 

  The Resource which implement AutoCloseable (I) ,those Resources are  considered as
    AutoCloseable Resources

*************************************Statements *********************************************

 a)Statement 
 b)PreparedStatement 
c)CallableStatement 

a)Statement                            : static queries 
b)PreparedStatement        : static or dynamic queries
c)CallableStatement          : For calling PL/SQL procedures,functions...etc


a)Statement                          
Statement st = con.createStatement(); 

->Hence Statement Object is not associated with any Query and we can use for multiple Queries.
->Whenever we are using execute Method, every time Query will be compiled and executed. 
->Statement Object can work only for Static Queries.
->Relatively Performance is Low.
->Best choice if we want to work with multiple Queries.
->There may be a chance of SQL Injection Attack.
->Inserting Date and Large Objects (CLOB and BLOB) is difficult.

stmt.executeUpdate(student_tab_query);  

b)PreparedStatement        : static or dynamic queries   (pre-compiled  sql query )

->At the time of creating PreparedStatement, 
we have to provide SQL Query compulsory and will send to the Database and will be compiled.

->Hence PrepareStatement is associated with only one Query.
  PrepareStatement pst = con.prepareStatement(query); 

->Whenever we are using execute Method, Query won’t be compiled just will be executed.
-> PrepareStatement Object can work for both Static and Dynamic Queries.
->Relatively Performance is High.
->Best choice if we want to work with only one Query but required to execute multiple times.
->There is no chance of SQL Injection Attack.
->Inserting Date and Large Objects (CLOB and BLOB) is easy.

In simple statement ::

String QUERY ="insert into student (sid,sName,schoolName) values (204,'suman','MySchool');"
Statement st = con.createStatement(); 
st.executeQuery(QUERY);

In Prepared Statement :

String QUERY ="insert into student (sid,sName,schoolName) values (?,?,?);"

Here '?'  : Positional Parameter OR Place Holders 

PrepareStatement pst = con.prepareStatement(QUERY); 

pst.setInt(1,200);
pst.setString(2,"Harish");
pst.setString(3,"H school");


** Steps to  Develop JDBC Application with PreparedStatement ****
1)Prepare SQL Query with paramater or without parameters

 ex : "insert into student (sid,sName,schoolName) values (?,?,?)"

Here '?'  : Positional Parameter OR Place Holders 

 For Just Understanding purpose :
                                      (?,?,?)   -> (?1,?2,?3)--> ?1   = sid ,?2 =sName , ?3=schoolName

2)PrepareStatement pst = con.prepareStatement(QUERY); 

At this  line PreparedStatement will be created with compilation of SQL Query. 
           (0r)
	   PreparedStatement object with 'pre-compiled sql query'

if query having input params ,then we have to provide values in the following way

pst.setInt(1,200);
pst.setString(3,"H school");
pst.setString(2,"Harish");

ResultSet executeQuery() throws SQLException;
int executeUpdate() throws SQLException;
boolean execute() throws SQLException;

*****  Static Query   vs Dynamic query ******

1)The SQL Query without positional parameter (?)  is called static queries

      ex : update employee eName='Rahul'     where eid=120;
 
2)The SQL Query with positional parameter (?)  is called dynamic queries

     ex : update employee eName='Rahul'     where eid=?;


Limitation of PrepareStatement ::
--------------------------000-------------------
->We can use prepareStatement for only one SQL Query  for mutiple times of execution.



Note ::
->Simple statement can be used only for static queries  where as prepare statement can be used
for both static and dynamic sql queries
->Statement is not associated with SQL query where as prepareStatement is associated with
 SQL query
 ->Simple statement is best suitable if we want to work with multiple Queries where as 
  prepareStatement if we want to work with only one Query but required to execute multiple times.

************************************************************************************************


SQL Injection Attack ::
**********************
In the case of Simple statement  every time query will be send to the database with user
 provided values.

 String uname ="harish'"+OR "1==1"; 

 eg : "Select count(*)  from fb_users where f_user="'+uname+"'";

      Select count(*) from fb_users wher f_user ='harish' or 1==1 ;

      Here 1==1 or 2==2 always return ,even though  he is not valid user ,user can able
       to access the web application by SQL Injection Attack

if it is Prepared statement ?

Select count(*)  from fb_users where f_user=?




c)CallableStatement :: 

Oracle                                           :PL/SQL
MySQL                                          :  Stored Procedure language
Microsoft  SQL Server           :Transact SQL (TSQL)



->if we want to call stored procedure  from java application ,then we should go for
Callable statement


 Callable statement is interface  present in java.sql.pkg

                                                       Statement                     (static queries )
                                                               |  extends
                                                    PreparedStatement        (dynamic queries)
                                                                  | extends
					           CallableStatement            (procedure ,funtion...etc)


 Driver software vendor is responsible to provide  implementation for callableStatement Interface

    public CallableStatement prepareCall(String sql) throws SQLException;

   CallableStatement cst = con.prepareCall("call GetAllEmployee()");

   Here      Call is JDBC keyword       ,GetAllEmployee is procedure name 

          


CREATE PROCEDURE getEmpNameById(
	IN  empId INT,
	OUT eName VARCHAR(25)
)
BEGIN
		 select concat(e.first_name,' ',e.last_name) as fullName into eName from demo.employee e where e.id =empId; 

END


Final Conclusion :
*******************
1)If we want to work with muliple queries then we should go for Statement Object.
2)If we want to work with only one query ,but should be executed multiple times then
 we should go for PrepareStatement Object. 
 3)If we want to work with stored procedures and functions ..etc then we should go for 
 CallableStatement

***********************************************************************************************

Batch update :: (Non-select queries )
************** **********************
When we submit multiple SQL queris  to the database  one by one will be execute  i.e 
it takes lot of time .

Then we choose batch update to perform multiple queries at a time .

Advantages ::
1)We can reduce network traffic b/w java app and Database.
2)It means we can performance 

We can implement batch updates by using below two methods ...
  1)public void addBatch( String sql ) throws SQLException;
          We can add queries to batch by above method

2)  int[] executeBatch() throws SQLException;
Above method is used to execute batch of sql queries at a time.

Note : we can implement batch update either by using simple statement or preparestatement

Limitations ::
************
We can use Batch update only for Non-select queries , if we are  trying to use for select
queries  then we get RE :BatchUpdateException

Execute Methods summary ::
**************************
In total 4 methods available ..

1)executeQuery()               ->Select queries
2)executeUpdate()            ->Non-Select quries
3)execute() 
        * For both Select and non-select queries
	* For calling Stored procedures

4)executeBatch()      ->For batch updates (only non-select quries)

   
**********************************************************************************************

Next Concepts ::
1)Handling Date values
2)Large Objects (Clob,blob)
3)properties
4)Connection Pooling
5)Transaction Management          
6)MetaData
7)JDBC with Excel sheet
8)ResultSet Types 
9)RowSets


  1)Handling Date values     

a)Read date value from input
 System.out.println(:enter DOJ");
 String doJ  =sc.next();

b)Convert date from string to java.util.Date with SimpleDateFormat (formating Date)
SimpleDateFormat sdf=new SimpeDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd");
java.util.Date utilDate       =sdf.parse(doJ);

c)Convert date from java.util.date to java.sql.Date
long dVal          =utilDate.getTime();

ps.setDate(index,new java.sql.Date(dVal));



2)Large Objects (Clob,blob) ::

Even we can insert blob (image.audio,videos....etc) and clob (text files..) in DB column.

To Store and retrieve large information we should go for Large objects (LOB's)

There are 2 types of Large objects

a)Binary Large Object (Blob)
b)Character Large Object (Clob)

a)Binary Large Object (Blob)
*****************************
A BLOB is a collection of binary data  stored as single entity in the database.

Here BLOB   : images ,Videos ,Audios....etc


A BLOB datatype can store maximum of   '4gb' binary data.


b)Character Large Object (Clob)
********************************
A CLOB is a collection of Character data  stored as single entity in the database.

Here CLOB   : text documents (plain text..)

A CLOB datatype can store maximum of   '4gb'  data.


Steps to insert BLOB Datatype into Database ::
************************************************
In Mysql blob respective datatype     : TINYBLOB, BLOB, MEDIUMBLOB, and LONGBLOB

a)Create table  with blob datatype column
ex :
----
CREATE TABLE `student` (
  `sid` int NOT NULL,
  `sName` varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
  `schoolName` varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
  `DOJ` date DEFAULT NULL,
  `image` blob
)

b)Represent image file in the form of  java File object

File imageFile =new File("budha.png");

c)Create FileInputStream to read binary data from image file 

FileInputStream fis =new FileInputStream(imageFile);

d)Create PrepareStatement  with insert query

PrepareStatement ps =con.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO student VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?,?)");

e)Set the Optional parameters

  public  void setBinaryStream(int parameterIndex, java.io.InputStream x, long length) throws SQLException

ps.setBinaryStream(5,fis,(int)fis.length());

      5                               - >  parameterIndex  
     fis                             ->is  the java input stream which contains the binary parameter value
    (int)fis.length() -> length the number of bytes in the stream


f) Finally call ps.executeUpdate();

Respective Methods are ::

public void setBinaryStream(int parameterIndex, java.io.InputStream x,long length) throws SQLException;
public void setBinaryStream(int parameterIndex, java.io.InputStream x) throws SQLException;
public void setBytes(int parameterIndex, byte x[]) throws SQLException;
..etc


b)Character Large Object (Clob)
********************************
A CLOB is a collection of Character data  stored as single entity in the database.

Here CLOB   : text documents (plain text..)

A CLOB datatype can store maximum of   '4gb'  data.



Steps to insert CLOB Datatype into Database ::
************************************************
In Mysql Clob respective datatype  are : TINYTEXT, TEXT, MEDIUMTEXT, LONGTEXT


a)Create table  with clob datatype column

CREATE TABLE `student` (
  `sid` int NOT NULL,
  `sName` varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
  `schoolName` varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
  `DOJ` date DEFAULT NULL,
  `resume` MEDIUMTEXT NULL
)

b)Represent text file in the form of  java File object

File txtFile =new File("resume.txt");

c)Create FileInputStream to read character daa from text file 

    FileInputStream fis =new FileInputStream(txtFile);
                                           (OR)                           
     FileReader fr =new FileReader(txtFile);

d)Create PrepareStatement  with insert query

PrepareStatement ps =con.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO student VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?,?)");

Here am taken 5th positional Paramater as  MEDIUMTEXT (Clob)

ps.setCharacterStream(5,fr);

5         ->parameterIndex
fr        ->reader

Respective Methods are ::

 public void setCharacterStream(int parameterIndex, java.io.Reader reader,int length) throws SQLException;
 public  void setCharacterStream(int parameterIndex, java.io.Reader reader) throws SQLException;
 public void setClob (int parameterIndex, Clob x) throws SQLException;
 ...etc

f) Finally call ps.executeUpdate();



4)Connection Pooling
***********************
 DriverManager.getConnection(DBCredentials.URL.getName(), DBCredentials.USER_NAME.getName(),DBCredentials.USER_NAME.getName());

if we required  to communicate with database for multiple times then it is not recommended
to create sepeparte Connection object every time,
** becoz  creatting and destroying Connection  object everytime create performance problem.

To overcome this problem , we should have to go for connection pool (For best resuability of connection)

Connection pool is a pool of already created connection object which are ready to use.

if we want to communicate with database then we can request  connection pool  to 
provide  connection.
Once we got the connection , by using that connection  we can commnunicate with database.
After completing communication with database ,then we can return  connection to the pool
instead of destroying or closing.

Hence we can get main advantage here is
* reusability of connection
* performance 




Steps to implementing Connection Pooling (Standalone):
************************************************************
1)Create of Datasource object

Datasource is responsible to manage connection  in connection pool

Datasource is a interface present in javax.sql pkg

Driver s/w vendor  is the responsible  to provide implementation.

The class present in Mysql driver s/w is MysqlConnectionPoolDataSource.java ,this class is
responsible to maintain Mysql Connection pool .

Here responsible means : 
                                                 * Creating of Connection
						 * Maintaining of connection
						 *If required even it can destroy


2)Set Required info (JDBC Props ) to the Datasource Object

DataSource    ds =new MysqlConnectionPoolDataSource();
ds.setUrl("url");
ds.setUser("user");
ds.setPassword("password");


3)Get the connection from Datasource Object

Connection con = ds.getConnection();
Once we got connection ,then we can communicate with database.


Note ::
->This way of connection from connection pool is useful for standalone application ,where as
 web application server is responsible to  maintain Connection pool which is nothing
 server managed connection pool . In this way we can classify these in two types ..as follows

          1)Standalone Connection Pool    
	  2)Server Managed Connection Pool


What is the diff b/w get Connection  object  by using DriverManager and Datasource Object..?

->In case of DriverManager.getConnection(), always a return a new Connection object.
->But In case of DataSource.getConnection() , a new connection won't be created and
  existing connection object will be returned from Connection pool.

@Configuration
class DBConfiguration{


@Bean
public DataSource getDataSource(){
      /// Provide JDBC pros (URL,user,Password either from application.properties/yml file)
 return ds;
 }

In Spring Boot By AutoConfiguration by default it will provide HikariDatasource (ConnectionPool)
      
}


5)Transaction Management      
******************************
The process of combining all related  operation into single unit, and apply one principle :
"do everthing or nothing prinicple";

Ex :
->Debit funds from source (sender) account to destination(reciever) account.

All above operations combined into a single unit ,(means debiting amount from source account 
                                                                                                                                         plus
                                                                                                          crediting amount to destination account )
then apply one principle : "do everthing or nothing principle"

Transaction Properties :
************************
Every Transaction  should follow four ACID properties.

1)A ->Atomicity 
        Either all operation  should be done or none.

2)C ->Consistency (Reliable Data or Correct Data)
 It ensure  bringing Database from one consistent state to another consistent state.

3)I-Isolation  (Separation)
Ensure that transaction is isolated from other transactions

4)D-durability
It means once transaction committed ,then the result are permanent even in the case of 
system  restarts,errors...etc

Types of Transactions :
***********************
There are two types of transactions

1)Local Transaction
2)Global Transaction

1)Local Transaction
All operations  in a transaction are executed  over same Database.

2)Global Transaction
All operations  in a transaction are executed  over different Databases.

Note ::
**imp*
        jdbc Supports only for Local Transaction.
If we want global Transaction then we should go for EJB or Spring framework.

Steps to implement Transaction Management in JDBC:
********************************************************
*By Default auto commit mode of DB s/w is true.

1)Disable auto commit mode of JDBC.

    con.setAutoCommit(false);

2)If all operations completed (SUCCESS), then we can commit the transaction by using below method

 con.commit();

 3)If  any sql query fail  then we have  to rollback operations which are already completed by using  
   below method

   con.rollback();

6)MetaData
7)JDBC with Excel sheet
8)ResultTypes              
9)RowSets

6)MetaData
Metadata         :  data about data

JDBC provides 3 types of Metadata:

1)DatabaseMetaData
2)ResultSetMetaData
3)ParameterMetaData



1)DatabaseMetaData
Connection con =ConnectionUtils.getConnection();
DatabaseMetaData metaData = con.getMetaData();
		  
2)ResultSetMetaData
 ResultSet rsOne=  stmt.executeQuery(FIND_ALL_EMP_DETAILS);
ResultSetMetaData rsMetaData= rsOne.getMetaData();

3)ParameterMetaData
PreparedStatement prepStatement = con.prepareStatement("select 1 where 1 > ?"))
ParameterMetaData parameterMetaData = prepStatement.getParameterMetaData();
     
 7)JDBC with Excel sheet  
 
Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver");  
 Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:odbc:abhishek");  
Statement st = con.createStatement();  
ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("Select * from [Sheet1$]");  
 ResultSetMetaData rsmd = rs.getMetaData();  
  
	  
8)ResultSet Types  
**************
Based on operation performed on ResultSet , we can divided into two types  .

 1)Read Only ResultSet
 2)Updatable ResultSet


1)Read Only ResultSet :
We can perform only read operation on the ResultSet by  using corresponding getter Methods
We cannot perform any updation .
By default ResultSet is read Only .

We can specifty explicity 

Allowed values for mode/resultSetConcurrency  are :

  int CONCUR_READ_ONLY = 1007;
  int CONCUR_UPDATABLE = 1008;

 ->PreparedStatement prepareStatement(String sql, int resultSetType, int resultSetConcurrency)throws SQLException;
 ->Statement createStatement(int resultSetType, int resultSetConcurrency, int resultSetHoldability) throws SQLException;

Here resultSetConcurrency  : CONCUR_READ_ONLY or CONCUR_UPDATABLE


 2)Updatable ResultSet
  The ResultSet  Which allows the programmers to perform  updation, such type of 
  resultSet  is called Updatable ResultSet

In this case we can perform select ,insert ,update ,delete.

if we want to change the mode/resultSetConcurrency ,then we have to provide this below value to
statement .
int CONCUR_UPDATABLE = 1008;

Based on cursor movement ,ResultSet  will be divided into two  types :
************************
1)Forward Only (Non-scrollable) ResultSet
2)Scrollable ResultSet 


1)Forward Only (Non-scrollable) ResultSet
It allows the programmer  to iterate records only in forward direction.
By default ResultSet is Non-scrollable.

    int TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY = 1003;

2)Scrollable ResultSet 
It allows the programmer  to iterate records  in forward/backward direction.

These are divided into two types :

1)Scroll InSensitive ResultSet
2)Scroll  Sensitive ResultSet


**Imp Methods for Cursor Movement of ResultSet ::

  Statement stmt=con.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE,ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);

  ResultSet rs=  stmt.executeQuery("select * from employee limit 10");

1) rs.next();
2)rs.getXxx();
3)rs.getRow();
4)rs.prevous()
5)rs.beforeFirst()
6)rs.afterLast()
7)rs.first();
8)rs.last();
9)rs.absoulte(int)                    :  It will start  with current Position 
10)rs.relative(int)                    :  It will start  with next Position
11)rs.isFirst();
12)rs.isLast();
13)rs.isBeforeFirst();
14)rs.isAfterLast();


RowSets :
*******
->By default RowSets are Serializable where as ResultSet is not  Serializable
->By Default RowSet is Scrollable and update  where as ResultSet are Non-Scrollable(Forward-Only) and not-updatable.
->ResultSet is Connected ... to use ResultSet Compulsory  database connection is required where as
 RowSet is disConnected .. to use RowSet Database Connection is not required.

Types of RowSets :

1)Connected RowSets
2)Disconnected RowSets
